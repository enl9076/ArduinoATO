# arduino_ato
This project was developed from my desire not to have to manually top off my fish tank every couple of days.

## Version 1
In this original version of the project I used the Arduino IDE to write the program and used the following hardware: 

* Arduino Uno
* Relay module
* Temperature probe
* Water level module (operating via a swith mechism)
* Submersible water pump

## Version 2
In this newer version (still in development) I am using VS Code and PyDuinoBridge library to write the program in Python. The hardware is largely the same but with a few upgrades. Hardware list below.
